Stuff to work on (aka feature requests)

## Materials

Drawing demo (minimal tiltbrush-like)

Physics demos
- smashing hands into balloons
- picking up & throwing objects

Navigation demos
- 3d flying (move in direction of wand, speed set by trigger squeeze)
- Teleport (fishing rod-style like in Steam's Lab)
- 2D walking (nausea-prone, but reduce field of view while moving)
- Also, how to draw some things relative to nav, e.g. vehicle mode
- Scaling self/world up & down?
- (Also something for the fake mode, when no HMD is available)

UI demos
- UI should normally be in-world, not HUD...
- Utilize mira to expose UI devices in world?

Integrating with spatial audio
- I have some gen~ ambisonic stuff that could be used, but need to embed an HRTF somehow

## Eng

- chaperone data
- rendermodels
- mirror texture outputs
- Battery status
- Controller vibration
- Front-camera (VIVE)

- Other headsets/drivers, e.g. OSVR
